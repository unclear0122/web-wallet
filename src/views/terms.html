                <p>BeetleCoin does not hold your keys for you. We cannot access accounts, recover keys, nor reverse
                transactions. Protect your keys and always check that you are accessing the application on the correct
                URL. You are responsible for your security.</p>

                <p>This software functions as a free digital wallet. The software does not constitute an account where
                BeetleCoin or other third parties serve as financial intermediaries or custodians of your BEET.</p>

                <p>While the software has undergone testing and continues to be improved by feedback from the
                user and developer community, we cannot guarantee that there will be no bugs in the software.
                You acknowledge that your use of this software is at your own discretion and in compliance with all
                applicable laws.</p>

                <p>You are responsible for safekeeping your passwords, private key pairs, recovery keys, PINs and any
                other codes you use to access the software. IF YOU LOSE ACCESS TO YOUR BEETLECOIN WALLET OR YOUR
                ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEYS AND YOU HAVE NOT SEPARATELY STORED A BACKUP OF IT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE
                THAT ANY BEET YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WALLET WILL BECOME INACCESSIBLE. All transaction requests
                are irreversible.</p>

                <p>The authors of the software, employees and affiliates of BeetleCoin cannot retrieve your private keys or
                passwords if you lose or forget them and cannot guarantee transaction confirmation as they do not have
                control over the BeetleCoin network. To the fullest extent permitted by law, this software is provided
